# Matplotlib Exercises

Collection of exercises using **Matplotlib** to visualize data in Python.

My Goal:
- Learn Matplotlib
- Practice converting numeric data into visualizations
- Build intuition for selecting appropriate plot types
- Create reproducible, well-documented examples

Each folder contains an exercise
